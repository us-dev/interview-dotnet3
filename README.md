# Comments on code delivery
- Not all unit tests are written for branch coverage. It can definitely be expanded.
- The documents are written using Swashbuckle especially the API project. Redoc should also work based on XML comment structure.
-- Multiple example for Swashbuckle can use a little more work using Filters.
- Validatation are left out. Fluent Validation can be used to perform different validation for each layer.
